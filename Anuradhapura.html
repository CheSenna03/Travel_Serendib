                  <p>This sacred city was established around a cutting from the 'tree of enlightenment', the Buddha's fig tree, brought there in the 3rd century B.C. by Sanghamitta, the founder of an order of Buddhist nuns. Anuradhapura, a Ceylonese political and religious capital that flourished for 1,300 years, was abandoned after an invasion in 993. Hidden away in dense jungle for many years, the splendid site, with its palaces, monasteries and monuments, is now accessible once again.</p>

              <p>Anuradhapura was founded in the 5th century bce and was the Sinhalese capital of Sri Lanka from the 4th century bce until the 11th century ce, when invasions from South India forced the shifting of the capital. The city was abandoned and overrun by jungle; in the 19th century it was rediscovered by the British and subsequently became a Buddhist pilgrimage centre. The revival of the city began in earnest in the 1870s. </p>

            <p>Gardens have always delighted man creating earthly paradises and reflecting the artistic culture and civilization of a particular time period. The 5th century AD Sigiriya gardens are celebrated as the largest and the most elaborate ancient garden complex in Sri Lanka. And perhaps providing us with a unique example of one of the oldest landscaped gardens in the world-one whose skeletal layout and significant features are still in a fair state of preservation. The historical importance of the gardens at Sigiriya lies essentially in two factors; one, their antiquity and degree of preservation, the other, their ingenious combination, on a grand scale, of at least three traditions of ancient landscape gardening.</p>
